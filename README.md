# VanillaBishMods

This is where all currently used/usable mods are stored. The Forge 
Launcher is the .jar file in the main directory. All mods in 
'Server-Side' are required to join the game standardly, any in 
'Client-Side' are optional.
Optifine is currently in its preview version (as MC 1.16.1 is new) and may have some graphic issues, if this is the case let me know and I can help.

To use the installer, just run it normally (double click, or run as java 
SE executable) and install as a client. All mods should be put into the 
newly made mods folder once you have run the game. The game will need a 
restart to register any new mods.

If you would like to have more variations of 
mods (e.g one for a 'techy' world and one for this server) let me know 
and I can walk you through how.
