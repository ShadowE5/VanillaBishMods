# VanillaBishMods

This is where all currently used/usable mods are stored. The Forge 
Launcher is the .jar file in the main directory. All mods in 
'Server-Side' are required to join the game standardly, any in 
'Client-Side' are optional.
Optifine is required to use shaders (and even without shaders may be worth installing as it can improve perfromance), but resource packs can be used standardly.
Some visual lag may be fixed by using a 'higher' version of shader - for some reason my computer runs 'High' or 'Extreme' better than 'Medium'.

To use the installer, just run it normally (double click, or run as java 
SE executable) and install as a client. All mods should be put into the 
newly made mods folder once you have run the game. The game will need a 
restart to register any new mods.

If you would like to have more variations of 
mods (e.g one for a 'techy' world and one for this server) let me know 
and I can walk you through how.
